# 🔐 Firebase Authentication Web App

This is a complete **Firebase Authentication Web Application** built with the goal of demonstrating and combining all the essential authentication methods offered by Firebase in one place.

## 📋 Overview

In this project, I have implemented various Firebase Authentication methods to make it easy for users to register or log in through different options. This web app is especially useful for developers, learners, or anyone looking to understand how Firebase Auth works in a real-world setup.

All authentication functions are implemented and organized clearly to ensure smooth usability and learning experience.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The main purpose of this project is to showcase all Firebase Authentication methods in one place, similar to how users explore them on the official Firebase documentation — but in a practical, working web app format.

Instead of just reading the docs, users can visit this app and directly see how each authentication method works, including Google Sign-In, Facebook Login, Email/Password registration, and more — all integrated and functional.

This makes it easier for developers, students, and beginners to learn Firebase Auth by seeing real-time working examples, rather than setting everything up from scratch.
